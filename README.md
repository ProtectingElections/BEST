# Best Electoral Systems Test

This is a web page version of the Best Electoral Systems Test. Its functionality is copied from the spreadsheet _Best electoral system test v4 ZEF_.

The website was designed to be as simple and straightforward as possible, and to import styles from IDEA's website. For convenience, the javascript and css are separated into their own files.

The tool can be accessed at https://github.com/protectingelections/best.

The file `ideaversion.html` contains the code snippet currently live at https://www.idea.int/node/323874/revisions/348265/edit. It combines the html, css, and js into a single page, and also contains the changes automatically made when posting source code into an IDEA basic page body. (Such as deleting some of the <head> contents.)
